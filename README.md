# AIOpsInterpretation
This repository contains the replication package for the "Towards consistent interpretation of AIOps models" paper.

## Introduction
We organize the repository as follows:
1. Experiment code: the experiment code is under the `experiment` folder;
2. Result analysis: the R code for result analysis is under the `analysis` folder.

## Environment
Get the environment ready: Our experiment is carried out using the following packages and versions:
- Python: 3.8.3
- R: 3.6.3
- Numpy: 1.18.5
- Scipy: 1.5.0
- Pandas: 1.0.5
- Sklearn: 0.0
- Mkl: 2019.0
- Rgf-Python: 3.9.0
- Xgboost: 1.2.1

We recommend using an [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) enviorment with Python version 3.8.3, install the `xgboost` and `rgf-python` packages through `pip`,then everything would be ready.
